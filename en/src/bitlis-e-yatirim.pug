        | Vahit Kiler, Chairman of the Board of Kiler Yarn Investments Inc., made statements about Kiler Yarn Factory, which has the distinction of being Turkey's largest yarn production facility under a single roof. He stated that they are firmly committed to Turkey's investment, employment, production, and export goals, saying, "As the Kiler family, we see every investment we make and every step we take as serving our country's economy and national independence." Stating that Kiler Yarn Factory has a special place for them despite Kiler Holding's comprehensive investments in different sectors, Vahit Kiler said: "Before implementing this investment, they asked us why we chose Bitlis, which is far from raw materials and has no market. Bitlis is where we were born and grew up. We don't want today's youth to experience the problems and scarcity we experienced in our youth. Therefore, even though we would earn less, we implemented this investment in Bitlis, our hometown. In fact, we didn't even request land incentives for this investment, which could have qualified for state land incentives."

      | Through Kiler Yarn Factory, which will produce with world-famous Aegean cotton, it is planned to provide an annual contribution of 48 million dollars to cotton farmers. Kiler stated that if cotton were sourced from closer cities, they would have gained a 5 percent advantage, but emphasized that what matters to them is not higher profits but producing the highest quality yarn. Vahit Kiler continued: "We aim to sell to global brands in European countries. For this, we will offer the highest quality products with the best raw materials and production technology, and create a 'world brand from Bitlis', God willing. We have the capacity to produce all types of yarn between numbers 16 and 80. We are receiving orders from the domestic market who are aware of our product quality. We will start exporting towards the end of the year."

      | On the other hand, with an expected annual average turnover of 75 million dollars, the Facility is also expected to have an import-reducing effect through domestic sales. The machinery and equipment used in Kiler Yarn Factory were specially produced considering the latest technology and energy efficiency. Kiler, who said "We will transform the technological advantage in machinery and equipment into quality products," also emphasized that the Facility, which will meet all of its energy needs from 'renewable energy', complies with 'zero waste' principles. Emphasizing that the investment underground is more than what's above ground, Vahit Kiler stated that a 6 km long ventilation channel was built. Even the dust from the facility doesn't turn into waste; it is separated and pressed through these channels and thus converted into fuel with 3500 calories.

      | Emphasizing that the people of Bitlis stood firm against terrorism for a long time, Kiler continued: "As the darkness of terrorism withdraws from our region, the potential of Bitlis and our other provinces emerges; today our city is one of Turkey's five safest and most peaceful cities. Now there is no concern, there is trust. Trust means investment. As the peaceful environment in our region strengthens, investments will progress even faster. As the Kiler family, we will continue to protect both Bitlis and our entire homeland."

With our belief in Turkey's rapidly advancing goals, we act with national responsibility awareness to reach the 'Turkish Century.'"

My brothers and I were born and grew up in Bitlis. Our hometown is always on our minds. That's why we make these investments for Bitlis to raise beneficial youth for our homeland. Bitlis and Turkey belong to all of us, and we will build an even brighter future together for our youth."
